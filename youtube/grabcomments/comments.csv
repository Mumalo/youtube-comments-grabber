Tracy	2016-09-05T00:08:23.000Z	0	I just ordered this same color. I have grey so I would have to do my roots first and then the last 10 minutes bring it down. The opposite. It looks great on you. How was the condition of your hair in about 2 or 3 weeks?  Did any break off or was your hair dryer than before?  I had to give up on the heavy hair dyes at the salon. The damage and its poison.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esQBYPTMm1k&lc=z12vspuqmleevnc2a22ecnrplka4crtxy04
Shelby k	2016-10-20T00:32:43.000Z	0	So do you color all of your hair every month or do you just touch up the roots?  I just ordered this brand of dye today and I'm so excited to use it!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esQBYPTMm1k&lc=z12ky1zwxv2ncxubf04cdhy4rvbxubhb5lc0k
